<p>In this chapter, the topic of <strong>functions</strong> will be introduced, together with cases in which they might be useful, as well as the <strong>primary concepts</strong> when working with functions. It will be demonstrated why it is a <strong>good practice</strong> to use functions, how to <strong>define</strong> them and how to <strong>call</strong> them. The concept of a <strong>parameter</strong> and a <strong>returned value</strong> of a function, as well as how we can further use the returned value from the function, will be introduced. At the end of the chapter, we&apos;ll look at what the <strong>best practices</strong> are when dealing with functions.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-function"><a name="what-is-a-function" class="plugin-anchor" href="#what-is-a-function"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>What is a Function?</h2>
<p>So far, we learnt that dividing our code into <strong>smaller units</strong> (functions), each of which being responsible for a specific functionality is more practical in general. Each unit is concerned with <strong>distinct functionality</strong>, in which case not only is it easier to process the problem we are facing, but also improves the <strong>debugging</strong> and <strong>readability</strong> of the code.</p>
<p>When we think about writing code, the function in practice can be considered as an <strong>encapsulated set of instructions</strong> which implement a required functionality. This set of instructions (i.e., the function) has its own structure, separated from the rest of the code. Throughout the code, we can <strong>always</strong> call the function when we need its functionality, simply by typing its name and giving appropriate arguments for its parameters, if there are any.</p>
<p>A function can be called as many times as we need to solve our problem. This prevents us from typing one functionality several times, which in turn reduces the risk of error if the function is changed afterwards.</p>
<p>We will look at two types of functions &#x2013; &quot;<strong>basic</strong> functions&quot; (without parameters) and &quot;<strong>complex</strong>&quot; functions (with parameters).</p>
<table>
<tr><td><img src="assets/alert-icon.png" style="max-width:50px"></td>
<td>In the object-oriented programming (which is out of the scope of this book) the functions are part of higher-level objects called <b>classes</b>, where functions are called <b>methods</b>. In other programming languages the functions are called <b>procedures</b>. </td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3 id="basic-functions"><a name="basic-functions" class="plugin-anchor" href="#basic-functions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Basic Functions</h3>
<p>The <strong>basic</strong> functions are responsible for the execution of an <strong>action</strong> which <strong>contributes</strong> to the solving of a particular problem. Such an action can be printing a string to the console, performing a conditional statement check, going through a loop, etc.</p>
<p>Now, let&#x2019;s look at the following <strong>example of a basic function</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/01.Simple-function-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The purpose of this function is to print a headline, which in this case is a string of dashes. Because of this, it is called <strong>&apos;print_header&apos;</strong>. The parentheses <strong>always</strong> follow the name of the function, irrespective of its name. It is important the names of our functions to describe the purpose of the function. Later in this chapter, we will learn more in-depth about the naming conventions regarding functions.</p>
<p>The <strong>function declaration</strong> is always followed by a <strong>colon</strong>, which is followed by the set of instructions (an algorithm), used for solving a particular problem, described by the name of the function. This part of the code is also referred as the <strong>body</strong> of the function which contains the machine code (the instructions). It is positioned on a new line after the function&#x2019;s declaration. It is written with an indentation compared to the function-defining line. The body of the function is always indented four spaces, or single Tab from the level at which the function declaration begins. This separates the body of the function as a single block of instructions. </p>
<p>If the given snippet of code is present in a program which is to be executed, the function will not affect the program at this stage, because the function is declared, but not called yet.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-we-use-functions"><a name="why-should-we-use-functions" class="plugin-anchor" href="#why-should-we-use-functions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Why Should We Use Functions?</h3>
<p>So far, we found that the functions help with the logical differentiation of a longer code to less complicated, easier to digest pieces. Working with functions gives to our code advantages, such as better structure and greater cohesion. </p>
<p>The usage of functions <strong>prevents us from code repetition</strong>. The repeating code is <strong>bad</strong> practice as it heavily <strong>impedes</strong> the code&#x2019;s maintenance and leads to errors. If a single of code functionality is present in our program several times throughout the code, and we need to change something to this functionality afterwards, we need to correct the same piece of code as many times as we have it in the program. The likelihood of missing one spot in the redaction of the code in this case is high, which results in an unpredictable behaviour. This is the reason why it is a good practice, if we do use a fragment of a code <strong>more than once</strong>, to define it as a <strong>separate function</strong>. </p>
<p>The functions <strong>allow</strong> us to use a piece of code <strong>several</strong> times. Working on more and more problems, you will notice that with the use of already existing functions you will save a lot of time and effort. </p>
<h3 id="declaration-of-functions"><a name="declaration-of-functions" class="plugin-anchor" href="#declaration-of-functions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Declaration of Functions</h3>
<p><strong>Function declaration</strong> can be considered as a registration of a given functionality within a program so that this functionality can be recognized and later used in the rest of the program where necessary. In the next example, we will explore the element of which a function is composed:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/02.Declaring-functions-02.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>def</strong>. The key word <strong><code>def</code></strong> in Python expresses the intention to declare a new function.</li>
<li><strong>Name of the function</strong>. The name of the function is <strong>defined by the developer</strong> and follows after the keyword <strong>def</strong>. It is important to describe the <strong>functionality</strong> which is bound to be executed by the function&#x2019;s instructions listed in its body. In our example the name of the function is <strong><code>calculate_square</code></strong> which hints us that the aim of the given problem is to calculate the squared value of a number.</li>
<li><strong>List of parameters</strong>. It is introduced in between the parentheses, which we put after the name of the function. Here we list the parameters which we want to include in the function. There might be a single parameter, several parameters or zero parameters (basic function). If we don&#x2019;t have a parameter, we leave the parentheses empty. In the function <strong><code>calculate_square</code></strong> there is only one parameter called <strong><code>num</code></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Colon</strong>. After the closing bracket we put a colon sign which initiates the beginning of the function&#x2019;s body.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation of function (body)</strong>. The body of the function is the place to put our algorithm (instructions) which solves the problem we deal with. The body, per se, implements the <strong>logic</strong> of the function. In the particular example we estimate the squared value of a given number which is <strong>num*num</strong>. the body is always indented and on a new line after the colon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the definition of a function, it is important to follow this exact <strong>structure</strong> of the function&#x2019;s elements.</p>
<p>When declaring a given variable in the body of a function, it is called a local variable for the function. The scope of the variable in which it exists and can be used starts with the line on which we have defined it and spans to the last instruction, part of the function&#x2019;s body. This space of definition is called <strong>field of scope</strong> for the variable. </p>
<table>
<tr><td><img src="assets/alert-icon.png" style="max-width:50px"></td>
<td>Some programming languages such as C or C++ distinguish between the <b>declaration</b> and the <b>definition</b> of a function. The <strong>declaration</strong> of a function informs the compiler or the interpreter that a function with its given name exists without imposing implementation. The <strong>definition</strong> of a function brings in the implementation of the function&#x2019;s body. Within the <strong>Python</strong> language this division into two steps does not exist, which in turn means that each function which is declared must also include some functionality (in the body).</td>

<h3 id="invoking-a-function"><a name="invoking-a-function" class="plugin-anchor" href="#invoking-a-function"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Invoking a Function</h3>
<p>The invoking of the function is regarded as the <strong>beginning of the execution</strong> of the code which is in the <strong>function&#x2019;s body</strong>. This is accomplished as the name of the function is called, followed by the parentheses. If the function expects input arguments for its parameters, they must be inserted in the parentheses in the same order in which the parameters were defined in the parentheses. An example that follows:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/03.Invoking-functions-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The given function can be called plenty of times from <strong>any</strong> location in the code. It&#x2019;s important to mention that if a function in <strong>Python</strong> is defined somewhere inside the code, the program will only recognize it if it is called after its definition within the code of the program.</p>
<p>As the invoking of a function is a command by itself, we can call a function from inside another function:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/03.Invoking-functions-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is also a possibility the function to be called in <strong>its own body</strong>. This is called <strong>recursion</strong>, for which additional information can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and we strongly encourage you to do your own research on the internet.</p>

<p>First, we need to create the function which <strong>prints the header</strong> of the receipt. Its name should be short and sensible which describes the task the function will execute. For example, it can be called <strong><code>print_receipt_header</code></strong> and its body will contain the following code:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/04.Print-receipt-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Similar to the first function, we will create another two functions which will print out the center part of the receipt (body) and the bottom of the receipt (footer). We will call them <strong><code>print_receipt_body</code></strong> and <strong><code>print_receipt_footer</code></strong>. </p>
<p>Next, we will create <strong>another function</strong> which wraps the three functions and call them one after another. Finally, we will call the function <strong><code>print_receipt</code></strong> in our program:</p>

<p>The program which contains four functions called inside another function is ready and we can run it and test it locally after which we should send it for a quality check to the Judge platform: <a href="https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#0" target="_blank">https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#0</a>.</p>

<p>To solve our problem using function, often in our practice we need an <strong>additional knowledge</strong> which varies with the problem we need to solve. <strong>The parameters of a function</strong> are supplementing us with this knowledge, hence the behaviour of the function depends on these parameters. </p>
<h3 id="use-of-parameters-in-a-function"><a name="use-of-parameters-in-a-function" class="plugin-anchor" href="#use-of-parameters-in-a-function"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Use of Parameters in a Function</h3>
<p>As we just mentioned, the parameters <strong>can be zero or as many as needed</strong>. When they are declared, commas are used to separate them from each other. The parameters can be of any type (number, string, etc.). The following is an example which demonstrates how exactly the parameters are being used in a body of a function.</p>
<p>This is an example of <strong>definition</strong> of a function which uses a <strong>set of parameters</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/05.Function-parameters-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example, we will be using two parameters called <strong><code>start</code></strong> and <strong><code>end</code></strong>, respectively. After the definition of the function, it can be used in the program &#x2013; we <strong>call</strong> the function including <strong>arguments</strong> for our parameters:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/05.Function-parameters-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case the numerical value of the argument is declared directly in the function (e.g., <strong><code>5</code></strong> for <strong><code>start</code></strong> and <strong><code>10</code></strong> for <strong><code>end</code></strong>).</p>
<p>When declaring <strong>parameters</strong>, they can be of <strong>any</strong> type (integer, string etc.) and each parameter has to have a meaningful name. It&#x2019;s important to notice that when the function is called, the <strong>arguments</strong> must be put in the <strong>exact same order</strong> as the parameters, declared in the definition of the function.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s look at another example of function definition which has a few parameters, each of a different type:</p>

<p>The first step is to <strong>create</strong> a function and give it a descriptive name such as <strong><code>print_sign</code></strong>. This function will have only one parameter &#x2013; integer number, which sign we want to check:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/06.Print-sign-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, we want to <strong>implement</strong> the logic which will check whether the input value is positive, negative or zero. Looking at the examples we can conclude there are three cases to consider &#x2013; the integer is bigger than zero, the integer is equal to zero and the integer is less than zero, which means we need to check <strong>three conditions</strong> in the function&#x2019;s body. </p>
<p>Then we need to read the input value and call our function:</p>

<p><strong>Python</strong> allows us to use <strong>optional parameters</strong>. This in turn allows us to <strong>skip</strong> initialization of the arguments if <strong>default</strong> ones are given to the parameters during the function declaration.</p>
<p>The following example will demonstrate the use of default arguments:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/07.Optional-parameters-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The given function <strong><code>print_numbers(&#x2026;)</code></strong> can be called in several ways:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/07.Optional-parameters-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On the first line the parameters use the following arguments &#x2013; <strong><code>start = 5</code></strong>, <strong><code>end = 10</code></strong>. With the second line the arguments will be - <strong><code>start = 0</code></strong>, <strong><code>end = 15</code></strong>. With the third line we have <strong><code>start = 0</code></strong>, <strong><code>end = 100</code></strong>. The last line will use <strong><code>start = 35</code></strong>, <strong><code>end = 40</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Before creating a function, which prints numbers on a single line with initial and final value, we must read the input from the console. Next, we choose a meaningful name for our function which shortly describes its purpose. This might be <strong><code>print_line</code></strong> and we can now build it:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/08.Print-triangle-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at the problems regarding console drawing, we remember that it is a good practice to <strong>divide the completion of the figure</strong> in several steps. We can simplify the problem by dividing the triangle into three sections &#x2013; upper, mid, and lower segment.</p>

<p>Up until now we were looking at functions that execute a particular action such as printing some text, value, or a string of characters on the console. Other than such functions, there also can be functions which <strong>return</strong> a value as a <strong>result</strong> of their execution &#x2013; for example, this could the multiplication of two numbers. It will be these functions which will be the topic of our discussion in the next few lines.</p>
<h3 id="the-return-keyword"><a name="the-return-keyword" class="plugin-anchor" href="#the-return-keyword"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>The return Keyword</h3>
<p>To return a value which is the result of the function&#x2019;s execution we use the return keyword. It must be <strong>used in the body</strong> of the function and indicates to the program to <strong>stop execution</strong> of the function and <strong>returns value</strong> to the caller of the function which is written as an argument after the keyword &#x2018;return&#x2019;. In the example that follows, there is a function which reads two names from the console, concatenates them, and returns them as a result:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/10.Return-operator-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <strong><code>return</code></strong> keyword can be used in functions which do not return anything (the <strong><code>return</code></strong> keyword must be last in the end of the function). The presence of the keyword allows the function to stop its execution without returning a value. In this case, the use of the keyword is helpful only to terminate the execution of the function. It is also possible for the <strong><code>return</code></strong> keyword to be used in more than one place in the function&#x2019;s body.</p>
<p>In the following example, we have a function which compares two numbers and returns as a result either <strong><code>-1</code></strong>, <strong><code>0</code></strong> or <strong><code>1</code></strong>, depending on whether the first argument is smaller, equal, or bigger than the second argument of the function. The function uses the <strong><code>return</code></strong> keyword on three different instances to return different values depending on the arguments fed to the function.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/10.Return-operator-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is important to notice that the returned value by the function can be of a <strong>different type</strong> compared to the argument&#x2019;s type - string, integer, floating point number etc.</p>

<p>After the <strong><code>return</code></strong> keyword in a given function, the execution of the function is terminated, and the execution of the program continues where the function was last called. If there are other instructions written after the <strong><code>return</code></strong> keyword, they will not be executed. Some IDEs (including <strong>PyCharm</strong>) will inform you with the following warning:</p>

<h3 id="functions-returning-several-values"><a name="functions-returning-several-values" class="plugin-anchor" href="#functions-returning-several-values"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Functions, Returning Several Values</h3>
<p>Up to this point we looked at functions which <strong>do not return any value</strong> and functions which <strong>return only one value</strong>. In practice, it is often sensible for a function to return <strong>more than one value</strong>.</p>
<p>To achieve this in <strong>Python</strong>, after the <strong><code>return</code></strong> keyword we list the values which are bound to be returned, separated by a comma. The following function accepts as parameters two integers (<strong><code>x</code></strong> and <strong><code>y</code></strong>) and <strong>returns two values</strong> - the integer and the remainder of their division:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/13.Return-multiple-values-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Invoking the function works as with functions which do not return a value or return a single value. To use the returned values, we can <strong>assign</strong> them to variables whose names are separated by commas as it demonstrated with <strong><code>a</code></strong> and <strong><code>b</code></strong>. After the execution of this example, <strong><code>a</code></strong> will hold the value <strong><code>3</code></strong> while <strong><code>b</code></strong> will hold the value <strong><code>4</code></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="variations-of-functions"><a name="variations-of-functions" class="plugin-anchor" href="#variations-of-functions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Variations of Functions</h2>
<p>In many programming languages <strong>identically</strong> named functions can be used throughout the code using only different parameters which is considered as <strong>function overloading</strong>. Python does not support this functionality, but a similar effect can be achieved with the unconditional parameters introduced earlier. </p>
<h3 id="functions-signature"><a name="functions-signature" class="plugin-anchor" href="#functions-signature"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Function&#x2019;s Signature</h3>
<p>In programming, the way a function is <strong>recognized</strong> is by looking at <strong>both</strong> its fundamental components - <strong>name</strong> and <strong>list</strong> of parameters, declared during the definition of the function. These components define its <strong>specification</strong>, and that&apos;s also known as <strong>signature</strong> of the function:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/14.Overloading-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example the signature of the function is its name <strong><code>print_name</code></strong> as well as its parameter <strong><code>name</code></strong>.</p>
<p>If in a program we have functions with <strong>identical names</strong> but <strong>different parameters</strong>, we are looking at function overloading. This functionality is not implemented in Python. </p>
<h3 id="variations-of-functions-in-python"><a name="variations-of-functions-in-python" class="plugin-anchor" href="#variations-of-functions-in-python"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Variations of Functions in Python</h3>
<p>Different options to call functions in <strong>Python</strong> can be achieved with the use of <strong>default arguments</strong> or more precisely with the dynamic allocation of arguments to declared parameters of the function. Let&#x2019;s look at the example from earlier with a function using a couple of default arguments:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/07.Optional-parameters-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As we already noticed, we can call this function using different combination of arguments which recall closely matched variants of the function:</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s consider the following function which calculates the area of a circle:</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-local-function"><a name="what-is-a-local-function" class="plugin-anchor" href="#what-is-a-local-function"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>What is a Local Function?</h3>
<p>We see that in this piece of code, in the function <strong><code>circle_circumference(&#x2026;)</code></strong> there is <strong>another</strong> function called <strong><code>circle_diameter(&#x2026;)</code></strong>. This function is also known as <strong>nested function</strong> or <strong>local function</strong>. The nested functions can be declared in every other function. They are only visible and can be called in the scope of the function in which they are declared. In the last example the function <strong><code>circle_diameter(&#x2026;)</code></strong> can be called only inside the body of the function <strong><code>circle_circumference(&#x2026;)</code></strong> rather than outside its body. </p>
<h3 id="why-using-local-functions"><a name="why-using-local-functions" class="plugin-anchor" href="#why-using-local-functions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Why Using Local Functions?</h3>
<p>With practice we will find that when we write a program, often it appears that we need to use our function <strong>only once</strong>. Other often faced scenarios are when the function of interest gets too long. We already mentioned that when a function uses too many lines of code, the code gets hard to maintain. In these cases, we can be assisted by the <strong>nested functions</strong>. They present us with the possibility to declare a function within a function, where a nested function can be used independently. This contributes to the function&#x2019;s code as it makes it <strong>cleaner</strong> and <strong>improves its readability</strong>. This in turn improves the correction time if a bug is spotted later and minimizes the probability of error when changes are made to the code. </p>
<h3 id="declaration-of-a-nested-function"><a name="declaration-of-a-nested-function" class="plugin-anchor" href="#declaration-of-a-nested-function"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Declaration of a Nested Function</h3>
<p>Let&#x2019;s again have a look at the example from before:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/15.Nested-functions-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example the function <strong><code>cirlce_diameter(&#x2026;)</code></strong> is nested as it is declared inside the body of the function <strong><code>circle_circumference(&#x2026;)</code></strong>. This means that the function <strong><code>cirlce_diameter(&#x2026;)</code></strong> can be used only inside the function <strong><code>circle_circumference(&#x2026;)</code></strong> but not outside of it. If we try to call the function <strong><code>cirlce_diameter(&#x2026;)</code></strong> outside the function <strong><code>circle_circumference(&#x2026;)</code></strong> this will cause an error during the execution of the program.</p>
<p>Nested functions have access to all variables which are declared inside the parenting function. In the discussed example <strong><code>pi</code></strong> can be used in the body of the function <strong><code>cirlce_diameter(&#x2026;)</code></strong>. This asset of the nested functions can make them a preferred choice to solve a particular problem. This functionality saves writing time and decrease the amount of used code which would otherwise be used to declare parameters and variables, already used in the parenting functions.</p>

<p>In this section of the chapter, we&apos;ll look at some <strong>classic approaches</strong> regarding the functions used in a program such as naming conventions, appearance and structure of the function&#x2019;s code.</p>
<h3 id="naming-conventions"><a name="naming-conventions" class="plugin-anchor" href="#naming-conventions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Naming Conventions</h3>
<p>When naming a given function, it is beneficial to use <strong>meaningful names</strong>. As each function is <strong>in charge</strong> of some functionality of the problem, it must be taken into account <strong>what task it will execute</strong> inside the program which makes it a good practice to <strong>name the function after the task it executes</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Python</strong>, the convention suggests that the functions must be written in lower cases, as well as that the words used to name the function must be separated by an <strong>underscore (<code>_</code>)</strong> (if there&apos;s more than one word). A good practice is that the function&#x2019;s name consists of a verb, or a pair of a verb and a noun, respectively. </p>
<p>Some examples of <strong>appropriate</strong> naming of functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>find_student</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>load_report</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>sine</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of <strong>inappropriate</strong> naming of functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Method1</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>DoSomething</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>Handle_Stuff</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>SampleMethod</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>DIRTYHack</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you can&apos;t think of an appropriate name, there is a good possibility that the function is responsible for more than one functionality or lacks a clearly defined goal. In such cases, it is better to think of how the function can be subdivided into smaller functions.</p>
<h3 id="naming-of-the-functions-parameters"><a name="naming-of-the-functions-parameters" class="plugin-anchor" href="#naming-of-the-functions-parameters"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Naming of The Function&#x2019;s Parameters</h3>
<p>In the naming of the <strong>parameters</strong> of the functions, the same rules apply as for the naming of functions. The differences are that it is nice to name a parameter using a noun or a pair of an adjective and a noun, respectively. It should be noted that it is a good practice for the name of the parameter to hint at its type.</p>
<p>Some examples of <strong>appropriate</strong> naming of parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>first_name</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>report</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>speed_kmh</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>users_list</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>font_size_in_pixels</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>font</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of <strong>inappropriate</strong> naming of parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>p</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>p1</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>p2</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>populate</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>LastName</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>lastName</code></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#x2019;s again recall how a function should execute <strong>only one</strong> particular <strong>task</strong> in the program. If this cannot be achieved, the next thing to do is to look at how to <strong>separate</strong> the function into a few other functions. As it was said, a name of a function should clearly and precisely state the purpose of the function. Another good practice will be to <strong>avoid</strong> making the function&#x2019;s name so long that it can no longer fit on the screen (relatively). If the code in the function gets too large nevertheless, it is recommended to <strong>divide</strong> the function&#x2019;s tasks into a few shorter functions within the function as demonstrated:</p>

<h3 id="structure-and-formatting-of-the-code"><a name="structure-and-formatting-of-the-code" class="plugin-anchor" href="#structure-and-formatting-of-the-code"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Structure and Formatting of The Code</h3>
<p>In writing functions, caution must be applied to use the correct <strong>indentation</strong> (one Tab into the function). In <strong>Python</strong>, incompatible <strong>indentation</strong> leads to a direct error and does not allow the interpreter to execute the code.</p>
<p>An example of a <strong>correctly</strong> formatted Python code:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/16.Good-practice-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>An example of a <strong>incorrectly</strong> formatted Python code (for this reason the last line is underlined in red):</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/16.Good-practice-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Another good rule of thumb is to leave <strong>one empty line</strong> between the loops and the conditional statements as well as <strong>two empty lines</strong> after the definition of a function. Also, try to <strong>avoid long and complex expressions</strong>. Practice shows that these practices improve the readability of the code and save the developer&apos;s time.</p>

<p>We can first print <strong>the hundreds</strong> as a text &#x2013; <strong><code>(the number / 100) % 10</code></strong>, after that <strong>the tens</strong> &#x2013; <strong><code>(the number / 10) % 10</code></strong> and at the end <strong>the ones</strong> &#x2013; <strong><code>(the number % 10)</code></strong>.</p>
<p>The first special case is when the number is exactly <strong>rounded to 100</strong> (e.g., 100, 200, 300 etc...). In this case we print &quot;one-hundred&quot;, &quot;two-hundred&quot;, &quot;three-hundred&quot; etc.</p>
<p>The second special case is when the number formed by the last two digits of the input number is <strong>less than 10</strong> (e.g., 101, 305, 609, etc). In this case, we print &quot;one-hundred and one&quot;, &quot;three-hundred and five&quot;, &quot;six-hundred and nine&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>The third special case is when the number formed by the last two digits of the input number is <strong>larger than 10 and smaller than 20</strong> (e.g., 111, 814, 919, etc.). In this case, we print &quot;one-hundred and eleven&quot;, &quot;eight-hundred and fourteen&quot;, &quot;nine-hundred and nineteen&quot;, etc.</p>

<h3 id="problem-string-encryption"><a name="problem-string-encryption" class="plugin-anchor" href="#problem-string-encryption"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Problem: String Encryption</h3>
<p>Write a function <strong><code>encrypt(letter)</code></strong>, which encrypts a given letter in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes the first and the last digit from the ASCII code of the letter and concatenates them into a string, which will represent the result.</li>
<li>At the beginning of the string, which represents the result, we will insert the symbol which matches the following condition:<ul>
<li>ASCII code of the letter + the last digit of the ASCII code of the letter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After that, at the end of the string, which represents the result, you concatenate the character which matches the following condition:<ul>
<li>ASCII code of the letter - the first digit of the ASCII code of the letter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The function should return the encrypted string.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>j &#x2192; <strong>p16i</strong><ul>
<li>ASCII code of <strong>j</strong> is <strong>106</strong> &#x2192; First digit - <strong>1</strong>, last digit - <strong>6</strong>.</li>
<li>Concatenate the first and the last digit &#x2192; <strong>16</strong>.</li>
<li>At the beginning of the string, which represents the result, concatenate the symbol, which you get from the sum of the ASCII code + the last digit &#x2192; 106 + 6 &#x2192; 112 &#x2192; <strong>p</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>At the end</strong> of the string, which represents the result, concatenate the symbol, which you get from subtracting the ASCII code &#x2013; the first digit &#x2192; 106 - 1 &#x2192; 105 &#x2192; <strong>i</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the function shown above, write a function which takes <strong>a sequence of characters</strong>, <strong>encrypts</strong> them, and prints the result on one line. </p>
<p>The input data will always be valid. The Main function must read the data given by the user &#x2013; an integer <strong>N</strong>, followed by a character for each of the following <strong>N</strong> lines. </p>
<p>Encrypt the symbols and add them to the encrypted string. In the end, as a result, you must print an <strong>encrypted string</strong> as in the following example:</p>
<ul>
<li>S, o, f, t, U, n, i &#x2192; V83Kp11nh12ez16sZ85Mn10mn15h</li>

<p>Our variable <strong><code>result</code></strong>, in which we will save the value of the result, we will give the initial value <strong>&quot;&quot;</strong> (empty string). We must run a loop <strong><code>n</code></strong> times, so that in each iteration we can add the encrypted symbol to the result string.</p>
<p>To find the first and the last digit of the ASCII code, we will use the same algorithm that we used to solve &quot;N-th number&quot; problem, while to create the string, we will proceed as in &quot;Number to a numeral system&quot;</p>
