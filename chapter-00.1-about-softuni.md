# The Software University \(SoftUni\)

[The Software University \(SoftUni\)](https://softuni.org) is **the largest training center for software engineers in the South-Eastern Europe**. Tens of thousands of students pass through the university every year. SoftUni was founded in 2014, as a continuation of the hard work of [**Dr. Svetlin Nakov**](https://nakov.com) in training **skillful software engineering professionals** by a practical, contemporary and high-quality education, that combines fundamental knowledge with modern software technologies and a lot of practice.

## The Automated Judge System

**The SoftUni Judge system** \([https://judge.softuni.org](https://judge.softuni.org)\) is an automated Internet system for **checking the solutions of programming exercises via series of tests**. The submission and verification happen in **real time**: you submit the solution and within seconds you get an answer whether it is correct. Each **successfully** taken test gives you the points it gains. For a completely correct solution you get all the points for this problem. For partially correct solution you get part of the points for the task. For a completely wrong solution you get 0 points. This how the **SoftUni Judge** looks like:

**All problems from the current book are available for testing in SoftUni Judge** and we strongly recommend testing them after you solve them to be sure you don't miss anything and that your solution works correctly according to the task requirements.

Keep in mind some **specifics about SoftUni Judge**:

* For each task the **Judge system keeps the best score you had**. Therefore, if you upload a solution with wrong code or lower score compared to the previous one, the system won't take away your points.
* The output of your program is **compared** by the system to a strictly expected result. Every **unnecessary symbol, missing comma or space** may lead to 0 points on a particular test. The **output** that the Judge expects is **described in the requirements of every task** and **nothing else should be added**. 
* **Example:** If the output requires to print a number \(ex. `25`\), do not display any descriptive messages such as `The result is: 25`, just print as it is required, i.e. only the number.

The SoftUni Judge system is **available any time** via its website: [https://judge.softuni.org](https://judge.softuni.org).

  * Using the SoftUni Judge system is **free** and it's not bound with the participation in SoftUni's courses.

We are convinced that after sending a few tasks **you will like getting instant feedback** for your solutions and the Judge system will become your favorite assistant in your programming practice.
